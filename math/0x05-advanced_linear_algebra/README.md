# 0x05. Advanced Linear Algebra

## various operations on matricies

First is the determinate, I then use that to calculate the minor. I then use
the minor to calculate the cofactor, which is used to calculate the adjugate.
The adjugate and determinate are used to calculate the inverse.

The task was to use only python to solve these problems, I am aware the numpy
is faster.
